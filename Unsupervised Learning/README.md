# Unsupervised Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of several **Unsupervised Learning** algorithms developed as part of the **Davila_INDE577** coursework. Each subfolder presents a different technique with code, visualizations, and relevant datasets or use cases.

## DBSCAN

Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (**DBSCAN**) is a powerful clustering algorithm especially useful for discovering clusters of arbitrary shape and identifying outliers.

## Image Compression Using SVD

This project demonstrates how **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** can be applied to compress images by reducing the dimensionality while retaining most of the image's visual information.

## K-Means Clustering

An implementation of the **K-Means** algorithm to partition data into `k` clusters. Includes visualization of clusters and centroid updates through iterations.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project illustrates how **PCA** reduces high-dimensional data into principal components to simplify data structure and improve interpretability or preprocessing.
