# Linear Regression Model - Machine Learning

This repository contains the implementation of the **Linear Regression** algorithm. Linear Regression is a fundamental and widely used algorithm for predictive modeling in machine learning. It is used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.

## Overview

The notebook `LinearRegression.ipynb` demonstrates the following:

1. **Preprocessing the Dataset**:
   - Loading and preparing the dataset.
   - Handling missing data and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Implementing the Linear Regression Model**:
   - A custom implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm.
   - Training the model with the dataset and making predictions.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluation of the Linear Regression model using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
   - Visualization of the regression line and the iterative process of training.

## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including:
  - Dropping unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
  - Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
  - Normalizing or standardizing continuous features (e.g., 'Hours Studied', 'Previous Scores').

### 2. Linear Regression Algorithm

The Linear Regression algorithm is implemented in the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Initialize the coefficients (weights) and intercept.
- **Step 2**: Compute predictions using the linear equation.
- **Step 3**: Compute the cost function (Mean Squared Error) and update the coefficients iteratively (for visualization, we simulate an iterative process).
- **Step 4**: Repeat until convergence or a maximum number of iterations.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

- The model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the test data.
- The performance of the model is evaluated using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: A measure of how well the model predicts the target variable.
  

### 4. Visualizing the Results

- A plot of the regression line is generated to visualize the model's fit to the data.
- The iterative training process is visualized to show how the regression line evolves during training.
- The progression of **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is plotted to track the model's improvement over time.

## Results

The Linear Regression model achieves a relatively good performance on this dataset with an **R-squared value of 0.81**, indicating that approximately 81% of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model. The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** decreases progressively as the model iterates over the training data.
