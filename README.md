# Davila_INDE577: Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the **Davila_INDE577** repository! This collection showcases a wide range of machine learning algorithms and techniques implemented as part of the INDE 577 coursework. The projects are divided into two major categories:

- 🧠 [Supervised Learning](#supervised-learning)
- 🔍 [Unsupervised Learning](#unsupervised-learning)

Each subfolder contains Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and visualizations that demonstrate how different models work in practice.

## 🧠 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning models are trained on labeled data to perform prediction or classification. This section includes:

- [Decision Trees](./Supervised%20Learning/DecisionTrees)
- [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](./Supervised%20Learning/KNearestNeighbors)
- [Linear Regression](./Supervised%20Learning/LinearRegression)
- [Logistic Regression](./Supervised%20Learning/LogisticRegression)
- [Neural Networks](./Supervised%20Learning/NeuralNetworks)
- [Random Forests](./Supervised%20Learning/RandomForests)
- [The Perceptron](./Supervised%20Learning/ThePerceptron)
- [XGBoost](./Supervised%20Learning/XGBoost)

## 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or structures in unlabeled data. This section includes:

- [DBSCAN](./Unsupervised%20Learning/DBSCAN)
- [Image Compression Using SVD](./Unsupervised%20Learning/ImageCompressionUsingSVD)
- [K-Means Clustering](./Unsupervised%20Learning/K-MeansClustering)
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](./Unsupervised%20Learning/PCA)
